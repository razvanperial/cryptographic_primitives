Rust Cryptographic Primitives
=============================

This repository contains a collection of cryptographic primitives implemented in Rust. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of cryptographic primitives that are easy to use and hard to misuse. 

This library was done as a personal project to learn Rust and cryptography, implementing some of the algorithms I learned in the "Secure and Dependable Systems" course at my university. The code is open source and I am happy to receive contributions and feedback.
